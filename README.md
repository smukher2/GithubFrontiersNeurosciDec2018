# Protocol: Organization of folders containing subfolders, files and codes. 

**1 RNAseq_ASUcyverseCluster_Results+Script/ contains 

  *1.1 The codes for analysis of RNA-seq mouse aging hippocampus data analysis codes from raw fastq to htseq counts for GSE61915, GSE73503 and GSE83931 in sub-folder MouseRNAseq_Aging_Scripts_ForGetDataToCountData/  The starting raw fastq files for this code were obtained from GEO using fastq-dump, the code for which is also inclided in the script. 
  
  *1.2 Another subfolder, MouseRNAseq_CellType_Results+Scripts_ForGetDataToCuffdiff2/ contains the codes for analysis of RNA-seq mouse cortex cell types from raw fastq to differential gene expression with cuffdiff2 for GSE52564. The starting raw fastq files for this code were obtained from GEO using fastq-dump, the code for which is also inclided in the script. 
  
**2 MouseAge/ 

contains the codes, input files and results for entire analysis of the mouse aging starting from htseq count files to WGCNA. The htseq count files were obtained with the scripts in RNAseq_ASUcyverseCluster_Results+Script/MouseRNAseq_Aging_Scripts_ForGetDataToCountData/
The minimum files and codes required to reproduce our results here are MouseAge.Rproj, MouseAge.Rmd, InputMsAge/ and InputHtseqCount/ After downloading these if the user runs the MouseAge.Rmd code in RStudio using command 'knit to html' or 'Run all' it should reproduce our results. 
  
**3 HumanAgeDis/ 

contains the codes, input files and results for entire analysis of the human aging and disease microarray data GSE33000 and GSE43490 from getting expression data from GEO to WGCNA. The minimum files and codes required to reproduce our results here are HumanAgeDis.Rproj, HumanAgeDis.Rmd and InputHuAgeDis/  After downloading these if the user runs the HuAgeDis.Rmd code in RStudio using command 'knit to html' or 'Run all' it should reproduce our results. 

**4 HuAgeDisVsMsAge/ 

contains the codes, input files and results for preservation analysis and hypergeometric enrichment test to compare the WGCNA results obtained from HumanAgeDis/ and MouseAge/ The minimum files and codes required to reproduce our results here are Pres&Hyper_HumanAgeVsOthers.Rproj, Pres&Hyper_HumanAgeVsOthers.Rmd and InputPreservation/  After downloading these if the user runs the Pres&Hyper_HumanAgeVsOthers.Rmd code in RStudio using command 'knit to html' or 'Run all' it should reproduce our results.
